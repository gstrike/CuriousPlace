# The Curious Place - NES Controller
A comfortable place for the code from my NES Controller on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/@GregStrike).  


In this video, we created a programmable & automated DIY NES Controller for the original Nintendo Entertainment System released back in 1985.  As part of that project, I created a Python script that's capable of converting FCEUX .FM3 files directly to a Kansas City Standard .WAV file.  It's a mess really, and has timing issues, but, thought some people may be interested in it.  In reality, there probably needs to be some feedback mechanism so the controller knows which frame of the game we're in.  This is likely coming soon! :)
